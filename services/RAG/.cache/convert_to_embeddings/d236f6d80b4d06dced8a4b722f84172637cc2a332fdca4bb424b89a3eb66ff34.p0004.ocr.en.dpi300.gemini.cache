For an intrinsic semiconductor, the concentration of holes and electrons are equal. That is:
n = p = ni; j = qni(un + up)E

pn = n?

For a dope semiconductor, the electron and hole concentrations, are not equal. If n > p, the material
is called n-type, and if p > n, the material is referred to as p-type. For n-type material, the majority
carrier is electron, while hole is the majority carrier in p-type material. To obtain charge neutrality,
Equation 10 applies.
q(ND + p - NA - n) = 0

ND and NA are the donor and acceptor impurity concentrations.
Solving Equation 9 and substituting it into Equation 10, yields quadratic equations given by
Equations 11 & 12.
For n-type materials, ND > NA, and n ≈ ND - NA
However, putting p = n?
n
into Equation 10, we have:
(ND - NA)n + n? - n?
n?
n =
(ND-NA) + (ND-NA)2 + 4n?

For p-type materials, NA > ND, and p ≈ NA - ND
However, putting n = n?
p
into Equation 10, we have:
(NA - ND)p + n? - p?
p =
(NA-ND) + (NA-ND)2 + 4n?
