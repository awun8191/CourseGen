For an intrinsic semiconductor, the concentration of holes and electrons are equal. That is:
n = p = ni; j = qni(un + up)E

pn = n?

For a dope semiconductor, the electron and hole concentrations, are not equal. If n > p, the material
is called n-type, and if p > n, the material is referred to as p-type. For n-type material, the majority
carrier is electron, while hole is the majority carrier in p-type material. To obtain charge neutrality,
Equation 10 applies.
q(ND + p - NA - n) = 0

ND and NA are the donor and acceptor impurity concentrations.
Solving Equation 9 and substituting it into Equation 10, yields quadratic equations given by
Equations 11 & 12.
For n-type materials, ND > NA, and n ≈ ND - NA
However, putting p = n?
n
into Equation 10, we have:
(ND - NA)n + n? - n?

For p-type materials, NA > ND, and p ≈ NA - ND

Example 3
Calculate the resistivity of an intrinsic semiconductor at room temperature and classify it as an
insulator, semiconductor or conductor. The electron and hole mobilities are: 1350 cm²/V and 500
cm²/V. The intrinsic carrier density and electric charge, are: 1010 cm-3 and 1.60 x 10-19 C.
Solution
The conductivity, o, is:
o = q(un + up) = 1.6 x 10-19 (1010 x 1350 + 1010 x 500) = 2.96 x 10-6 (2. cm)-1
Resistivity, p, is:

p = = 3.38 x 105 2.cm

Example 4
Find the type and electron, and hole concentrations in a silicon sample at room temperature, if it
is doped with boron concentration of 1016 /cm³ and a phosphorus concentration of 2 x 1015 /cm³.
Solution
Boron is an acceptor impurity and phosphorous is a donor impurity. Hence,
NA = 1016 cm-3 and ND = 2 x 1015 cm-3
Since NA > ND, the material is p-type. The hole concentration, p, is:
p ≈ NA - ND = 8 x 1015 cm-3
At room temperature, the intrinsic concentration, ni = 1010 cm-3
