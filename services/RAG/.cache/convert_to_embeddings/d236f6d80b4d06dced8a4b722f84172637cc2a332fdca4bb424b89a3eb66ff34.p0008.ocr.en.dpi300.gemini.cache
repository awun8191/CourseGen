The quantity kT is called the thermal voltage, having an approximate value of 0.025 V at room
q
temperature.
Example 5
The hole concentration in silicon at T = 300 K, varies linearly from x = 0 to x = 0.01 cm. The
hole diffusion coefficient, is Dp = 10 cm²/s, the hole diffusion current density is J = 20 A/cm²,
and the hole concentration at x = 0, is p = 4 × 1017 cm-3. Determine the hole concentration at
x = 0.01 cm.
Solution
The hole diffusion current density, is:
Jp = (+q)Dp (op) = -qDp (op)
дх дх
Jp = (-1.6 × 10-19 × 10 x p(0.01) - p(0))
0.01 - 0
20 = -1.6 × 10-18 x p(0.01) - 4 × 1017
0.01
The concentration of hole at x = 0.01 cm, is:
p(0.01) = 2.75 × 1017 cm-3
Exercise 2
Assume that, in an n-type semiconductor at T = 300 K, the electron concentration varies linearly
from 1 × 1018 to 7 × 1017 cm-3, over a distance of 0.10 cm. Calculate the magnitude of the
diffusion current density if the diffusion coefficient is: Dn = 225 cm²/s. (J = 108 A/cm²)
