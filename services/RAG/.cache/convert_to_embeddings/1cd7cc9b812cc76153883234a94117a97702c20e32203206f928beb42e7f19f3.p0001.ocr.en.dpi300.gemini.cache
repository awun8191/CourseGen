Carrier and transport phenomena in semiconductor

The fabrication of integrated circuits, relies on the detail understanding of the properties of solid
materials. Solid-state electronic materials are usually divided into: insulator, semiconductor, and
conductor. This study focuses on the carrier and transport phenomena in semiconductor.

The net flow of electrons and holes in a semiconductor or in any material, is called, transport. For
an intrinsic semiconductor, the density of free electron or intrinsic carrier density, n, (cm-3), can
be determined by using the empirical equation presented by Equation 1.

n = BT exp(-E/kT) 1

where E is the semiconductor bandgap energy in eV (electron volts), k is the Boltzmann's
constant, 8.62 x 10-5 eV/K; T is the temperature, and B is the material-dependent parameter,
1.08 x 1031 and 2.31 x 1030 K-3cm-6 for Silicon and Germanium.

Example 1

Calculate the theoretical value of n, in silicon and germanium at room temperature.

Answers: n = 6.73 x 109 and 2.27 x 1013 cm-3 for silicon and germanium.
