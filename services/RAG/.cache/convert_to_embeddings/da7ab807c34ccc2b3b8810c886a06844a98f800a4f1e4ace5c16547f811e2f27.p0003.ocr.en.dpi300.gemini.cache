nucleus = proton + neutron
proton = electron = atomic number
Atomic Structure
According to the modern theory, matter is electrical in nature is all the
materials are comprised of very small particles called atoms. Atoms are
the building bricks of all matter i.e. an atom consists of a central nucleus
of positive charge around which small negatively charged particles called
electrons revolve in different parts or orbits.

nucleus

neutron
Nucleus: It's the central part of an atom and contains protons and neutrons,
positively charged
Proton: It is a positively charged particle
Neutron: It has the same mass as the proton, but has no charge
The sum of protons and neutrons constitute the entire weight of an atom
and is called atomic weight.
Atomic weight = no. of protons + no. neutrons
Extra nucleus: It is the outer part of an atom and contains electrons
only. An electron is a negatively charged particle with negligible mass,
the charge on an electron is equal but opposite to that on a proton, also
the number of electrons is equal to the no. of protons in an atom under
ordinary conditions, therefore an atom is neutral as a whole.
Atomic number: is the number of protons or electrons in an atom.
Atomic no = no. of protons or electrons
