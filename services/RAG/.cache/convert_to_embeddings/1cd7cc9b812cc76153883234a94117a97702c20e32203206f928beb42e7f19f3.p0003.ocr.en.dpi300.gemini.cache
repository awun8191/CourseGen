Example 2

Calculate the velocity of a hole in an electric field of 10 V/cm. What is the electron velocity in the
electric field of 2000 V/cm? The voltage across a resistor is 1 V, and the length of the resistor is
2 μm. What is the electric field in the resistor? Note: for silicon, the electron and hole mobilities
are: 1350 and 500 cm2/V.

Having known the drift velocity in the semiconductor, the next thing is to derive equations for
the current density. The current density due to drift transport mechanism, is the product of the
charge density and the drift velocity. That is:

Jn = qn Vn = qn(-unE) = qnunE 3

Jp = qp Vp = qp(upE) = qpupE 4

Hence, the total current density due to drift, is:

J = Jn + Jp = qnunE + qpupE = q(nun + pup)E 5

where q is an electric charge; n and p, are electron and hole concentrations or densities.

From Equation 5, the electrical conductivity of the semiconductor, is:

σ = q(nun + pup) (Ω. cm)-1 6

Resistivity is the reciprocal of conductivity. Therefore, the resistivity can be determined by using
Equation 7.

ρ = 1/σ = 1/(q(nun + pup)) (Ω. cm) 7
