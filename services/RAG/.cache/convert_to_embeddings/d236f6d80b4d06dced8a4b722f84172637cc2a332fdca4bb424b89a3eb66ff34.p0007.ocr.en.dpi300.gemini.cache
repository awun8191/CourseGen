Dp and Dn are proportionality constants, called hole and electron diffusivities, or diffusion
coefficients, with units (cm²/s).

The Einstein Relation
Diffusivity and mobility of charge carriers, are related by Einstein relationship. Avoiding further
derivation, the Einstein relationship, is as given in Equation 15.
