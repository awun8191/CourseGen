There are two main transport phenomena in a typical semiconductor. That is:
1. Drift and
2. Diffusion

Drift currents and mobility in semiconductor

Drift is a term used to describe the net flow of electrons and holes due to the application of electric
field. The electric field applied across a semiconductor, causes the carriers to drift through the
semiconductor. As shown in Figure 1, the electric field applied to the rectangular bar semiconductor,
causes the drifting of electrons and holes in different directions.

The drift velocity is the product of the carrier mobility and the electric field. That is:

Vn = -unE and vp = upE 2

where vn is the velocity of electrons (cm/s); vp is the velocity of holes; un and up are the
electron and hole mobility in cmÂ²/V; E is the electric field in V/cm.
