The electron concentration, n, is:
n =
n?
p
= 1.25 × 104 cm-3
In summary, the conductivity of materials is the product of their charge concentration and the
electron mobility.
o = qnun = q(ND - NA)un for n-type material
o = qpup = q(NA - ND)up for p-type material
Exercise 1
Calculate the resistivity of silicon doped with a donor density ND = 2 × 1015 cm-3. What is the
material type? Classify the sample as an insulator, semiconductor or conductor.
Diffusion current in semiconductor
Diffusion is the second mechanism that can induce a current in a semiconductor. Diffusion is
typically a process whereby particles flow from a region of higher concentration towards a region
of low concentration. If the particles were electrically charged, the net flow of the charge result in
a diffusion current. As shown in Figure 2, the gradient is positive in the +x-direction, but the
carrier diffuses in the -x-direction, from high to low concentration. The diffusion of electrons
from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration produces a flux of electrons
flowing in the negative x-direction. Likewise, the diffusion of holes from a region of high
concentration to a region of low concentration, produces a flux of holes in the negative x-direction.
Therefore, the diffusion current densities are proportional to the negative of the carrier gradient.
The following equations hold for diffusion currents:
