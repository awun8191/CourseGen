Total Current Density in Semiconductors
Current induces in a semiconductor, is due to the drift and diffusion of charge carriers.
Therefore, the total current density in semiconductor, is the total sum of the current densities due
to drift and diffusion of holes and electrons. That is:
JT = qnµnEx + qpUpEx + qDn (on) - qDp (op) 16

Example 6
Assume that the mobility of a particular carrier, is: μ = 1200 cm²/Vs, at T=300 K. Determine the
diffusion coefficient of the material.
Solution
To solve this problem, simply use the Einstein relation.
D = (kT) μ = 0.025 × 1200 = 31.1 cm²/s
q
If the diffusion coefficient is, D = 210 cm²/s, determine the carrier mobility at room temperature.
(Ans: 8108 cm²/s)

Characteristic of Junction Diode
Diode has its major application in the design of rectifier circuits. A diode rectifier forms the
first stage in a dc power supply. A dc voltage is required to power essentially every electronic
device, including personal computers, televisions, and stereo systems. Moreover, battery chargers
for portable electronic devices such as cell phones and laptop computers contain rectifier circuits.
